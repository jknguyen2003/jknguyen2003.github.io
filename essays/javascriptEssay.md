  My first thought about Javascript is that it is remarkably similar to regular java except a lot
easier to code because you don't have to use types like int or string. Because regualr java was 
one of the first languages in high school, I'd say that it is like my mother language. 
I'm most comfortable with it. Because of that, javascript feels right at home.  After coming 
from C last semester, which felt awful to code, javascript feels like a breath of fresh air. 
  For the most part, I didn't feel like Javascript is too far off from Java. However, during the 
javascript bootcamp activity that we did for hw, the extra 30 bonus problems really confused me.
It introduced a lot of different functions that could be used but was very difficult to understand
for me. I guess after using the same if and for loops, I'm stuck in my ways and I don't like 
change. Especially the arrow notation, which I guess would make functions one line and easier to
read potentially, but I prefer the classic way to do it. 
  Concerning the WODs, I do think they're useful, but only doing one a week I feel like is not 
sufficient practice. Hopefully, there's a resource to do many WOD's in a row because the WOD's do
not take more than a couple of minutes to complete for the most part. (Note from me from the future,
the WODS do get harder and there are TA WODS D:)
  For this class, I really enjoy the aspect of knowing that what I'm learning right now will be
relevant to be in the future for my job because I'm looking for a job in software engineering. 
Hopefully, I get to learn all the skills I need to be succesful and to stand out from other 
applicants in my field.
