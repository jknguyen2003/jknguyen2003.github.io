### I. Introduction


### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18
Since most Experience WODS have video tutorials underneath them explaining how to do them, I never really felt the need to use AI to complete them
  2. In-class Practice WODs
Since these weren't graded, I wanted to try to get as much practice in as possible. I would only use AI to see what it would implement and then figure it out by myself from there.
  3. In-class WODs
Since these are worth 100 points each, AI was used quite a bit. Unfortunately, this backfired on me occasionally as some of the code that it spit out was completely useless. There was also a time where I was trying to figure out why a website wasn't working but I realized the code was already there, I just had to log in. 
  4. Essays
Since essays are something that are very personal, I have never used AI for essays (in this class). We are also told explicitly not to use AI. 
  5. Final project
A good portion of my code was developed with the help of AI. Editing data with Mongo was not something I was very confident with so I needed assistance. 
  6. Learning a concept / tutorial
I have definitely used AI to teach me complex concepts in this class and others. For example, in ICS 311: Algorithms, I definitely asked ChatGPT to help me understand complex topics. Especially since you can ask it specific questions, it's like having a personal tutor that you can ask anything without feeling embarrassed. 
  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord
I haven't really used the class discord much to ask questions so no, I haven't used AI for this.
  8. Asking or answering a smart-question
See #7
  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”
I have definitely used AI to give me an example of code as a template in order for me to understand another set of code I was working on. I would do this so that I could practice the problem myself without giving away the answer completely. 
  10. Explaining code
I would only really ask ChatGPT to explain code that it gave me itself, since a lot of the times it doesn't make sense. 
  11. Writing code
Oh boy, if I am ever feeling lazy, I'll just ask it to write a block of code for me and I'll just CtrlC + Ctrl V and hope it works. 
  12. Documenting code
I have never asked ChatGPT to document code for me but I might start.  
  13. Quality assurance 
I've ran some essays through ChatGPT as a spell check and to ask for any suggestions to my essays. 
  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above
None that I can think of!

### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
  The first and most obvious problem with ChatGPT is that it takes away the struggle. When I first started coding in highschool, the only way you could really cheat was stackoverflow. But that was a public forum so you would either need to find someone with the exact same problem as you (which is surprisingly common) or you would have to ask the question yourself. This wouldn't always be the most helpful solution however so you would often times just be better of figuring out the problem by yourself. While this was a lot more difficult, for me personally, my problem solving skills were much better when I knew that I couldn't just plug my problem into ChatGPT and get an instant answer. Nowadays, if I can't figure it out within 5-10 minutes, I'll just resort to the AI overlord.
  Secondly, AI makes a lot of assignments and online exams trivial. This reduces the stress when a test rolls around because you know you can just ChatGPT your way to a good grade most of the time resulting in the amount of learning you're doing by a significant amount.
