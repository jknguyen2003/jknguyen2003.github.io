For our final project during my intro to coding class my freshman year of high school, I decided to make a turn based rpg video game. And while I did have a partner, I pretty much did 100% of the work. We did this on python using pycharm (and something else, it was a long time ago...) and it even had graphics and. I was very passionate about this project to the point where I would just code on my free time because I was having a blast. This project was a major turning point in my coding career because this was when I discovered how addicting coding could be. Every time I had a major bug and I finally fixed the problem, the sense of accomplishment was like nothing I've ever experienced before. Seeing something that I imagined in my head visually on the screen was a surreal experience. Despite the fact that I had already checked every single box on the list of requirements for the assignment, I kept pushing for more features simply because I enjoyed doing it. At the end of it all, I had over 1,000 lines of code, and as expected, I got a perfect on the assignment as well as my teachers praise. Unfortunately, I lost this gem to my laptop which is now lost somewhere. Hopefully when I have time in the future, I'll be able to remake the game and make it even better!
