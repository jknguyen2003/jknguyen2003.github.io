summary: "Final project of my ICS 314 class"
---

For our final project during my ICS 314 class, we made a website that allows you to find clubs from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. It allows users to create accounts and make their own clubs as well as edit and delete them. Users are able to add a picture as well as a description for their clubs.

Listed below is the link to our website and github home page:
