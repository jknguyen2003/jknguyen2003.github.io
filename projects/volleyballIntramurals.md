summary: "I led a team of inexperienced volleyball players to a win in our intramurals league."
---

For some context, we had 9 people on our team. Only a few of us had any actual experience, the rest were beginners. As a matter of fact, one of the guys had never even played volleyball before. Our opponents? You could tell that every single one of them had played before. They all knew what they were doing and they all knew each other. Our team was thrown together last minute, I only knew one guy on the team prior to the first game. Unsurprisingly, we got dominated during our first game. Almost all of our points were won by the opponents mistakes. And the worst part was that I felt helpless, I was only 1 out of 6 people on the court. There was only so much I could do when our beginners couldn't even pick up a single serve. After the game ended, I felt bitter and had a burning desire to win. I knew that I had to take the game into my own hands, so afterwards, I coordinated everyone on the team into a group chat and assigned everyone positions and explained rotations to the newbies. I scheduled a group practice game where I taught everyone where they should be at any given time. Our second game was also a loss unfortuntely, but unlike the first game, it actually felt like we had a winning chance. We made a few tweaks and adjustments, and on our 4th game, we finally took a set.
